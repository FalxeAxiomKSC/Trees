# Native Landscape Design Tool - Development Roadmap

This document outlines the iterative development process for the Native Landscape Design Tool project. The roadmap is organized into phases, with each phase building upon the previous one to create a comprehensive landscape design tool focused on native plants for the Fayetteville, AR area.

## Phase 1: Foundation and Data Collection

**Goal**: Establish project structure and gather essential data sources

### Milestones:
1. ✅ Set up GitHub repository and project structure
2. ✅ Gather climate data for Fayetteville, AR (72704)
3. ✅ Collect soil data from USDA NRCS
4. ⏳ Research native plants suitable for the region
5. ⏳ Study Fayetteville AR drainage manual guidelines (Appendices B, C, D, F)

### Deliverables:
- ✅ Project repository with organized directory structure
- ✅ Documentation of climate and soil data sources
- ⏳ Database of native plants with characteristics
- ⏳ Summary of municipal guidelines relevant to landscape design

## Phase 2: Core Functionality Development

**Goal**: Develop the fundamental algorithms and data models

### Milestones:
1. Create data models for environmental factors (climate, soil, topography)
2. Develop plant database schema with attributes (water needs, sun requirements, etc.)
3. Implement basic algorithm for matching plants to site conditions
4. Create simple visualization of site conditions

### Deliverables:
- Environmental factor data models
- Plant database with complete attributes
- Initial matching algorithm
- Basic visualization module

## Phase 3: User Interface and Interaction

**Goal**: Build an interactive interface for users to input site parameters and view results

### Milestones:
1. Design user interface wireframes
2. Implement site parameter input forms
3. Develop interactive map visualization
4. Create plant selection and filtering functionality
5. Implement basic reporting features

### Deliverables:
- User interface for parameter input
- Interactive map visualization component
- Plant selection and filtering module
- Basic report generation

## Phase 4: Advanced Features and Refinement

**Goal**: Enhance the tool with advanced features and improve accuracy

### Milestones:
1. Implement topography analysis and water flow modeling
2. Add microclimate detection and modeling
3. Develop plant community and companion planting recommendations
4. Create seasonal visualization options
5. Implement water usage calculation and optimization

### Deliverables:
- Topography and water flow analysis module
- Microclimate modeling component
- Plant community recommendation system
- Seasonal visualization options
- Water usage calculator and optimizer

## Phase 5: Testing, Validation, and Deployment

**Goal**: Ensure accuracy, usability, and prepare for public release

### Milestones:
1. Conduct comprehensive testing with various site conditions
2. Validate plant recommendations with local experts
3. Perform usability testing with potential users
4. Optimize performance and responsiveness
5. Prepare documentation and help resources

### Deliverables:
- Test results and validation report
- Usability feedback and improvements
- Performance optimization report
- User documentation and help resources
- Production-ready application

## Phase 6: Expansion and Maintenance

**Goal**: Expand capabilities and maintain data currency

### Milestones:
1. Expand geographic coverage to additional regions
2. Incorporate climate change projections and adaptation strategies
3. Add integration with external tools and services
4. Implement user feedback mechanism
5. Establish regular data update process

### Deliverables:
- Extended geographic coverage
- Climate adaptation module
- External tool integration capabilities
- User feedback system
- Data maintenance protocol

## Iterative Development Approach

Throughout all phases, we will follow an iterative development approach:

1. **Plan**: Define specific objectives and tasks for each iteration
2. **Develop**: Implement the planned features and functionality
3. **Test**: Verify the implementation meets requirements
4. **Review**: Gather feedback and identify improvements
5. **Refine**: Make necessary adjustments based on feedback
6. **Repeat**: Begin the next iteration with updated plans

Each iteration will typically last 2-4 weeks, with regular commits to the repository at logical milestones. This approach allows for continuous improvement and adaptation based on emerging requirements and feedback.

## Current Status

We are currently in **Phase 1: Foundation and Data Collection**. We have completed the initial project setup and begun gathering environmental data. Next steps include completing the plant database, researching municipal guidelines, and developing the foundational files for the core functionality.
