## Iterative Development Approach

Throughout all phases, we have followed an iterative development approach:

1. **Plan**: Define specific objectives and tasks for each iteration
2. **Develop**: Implement the planned features and functionality
3. **Test**: Verify the implementation meets requirements
4. **Review**: Gather feedback and identify improvements
5. **Refine**: Make necessary adjustments based on feedback
6. **Repeat**: Begin the next iteration with updated plans

Each iteration has typically lasted 2-4 weeks, with regular commits to the repository at logical milestones. This approach has allowed for continuous improvement and adaptation based on emerging requirements and feedback.

## Current Status

We have completed **Phases 1-3** and made significant progress in **Phase 4** and **Phase 5**. The tool now features:

- ✅ A complete project structure with all foundational components
- ✅ Comprehensive environmental data integration
- ✅ Map-based location selection with polygon drawing
- ✅ Hand-drawn landscape architecture aesthetic
- ✅ Interactive plant placement system with fixed plants
- ✅ Environmental compatibility checking
- ✅ Companion plant recommendations

Next steps include completing the remaining items in Phase 4 (topography analysis, microclimate modeling, seasonal visualization) and continuing with Phase 5 validation and optimization tasks.
