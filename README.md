# Native Landscape Design Tool

An algorithmically generated landscape design tool that creates maps based on water needs, soil structure, shade, topography, and other environmental factors. This tool focuses on native plants for the Fayetteville, AR (72704) area.

## Project Overview

This tool aims to help users create sustainable, native landscape designs by considering:

- Local climate conditions
- Soil characteristics
- Water requirements
- Shade patterns
- Topography
- Municipal guidelines for green infrastructure

## Data Sources

The tool integrates data from multiple authoritative sources:

- USDA NRCS (Natural Resources Conservation Service)
  - Ecological sites information
  - Soil classifications
  - PLANTS Database
- NOAA climate data
- Missouri Botanical Garden Plant Finder
- Fayetteville AR drainage manual (Appendices B, C, D, F)
- Local university agricultural and botanical data
